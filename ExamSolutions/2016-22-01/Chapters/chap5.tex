\section{ Question 5:Exoplanets }\label{sec:q5}    


\textbf{(a)} 1) Determine P and K from the plot: 90 days and 25 m/. From there, you calculate Mp sin(i) and eccentricity of 0.


2) The parent star orbits another star or it is a two system body.


3) For example, if there are two bodies, you can separate the two frequencies. You can detect another star with other methods such as the transit method.


\textbf{(b)} The size of the ring, the density and the obliquity. The most size and density, the more depth. When the ring is located perpendicular to the line of sight, you have the most depth.
